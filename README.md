Hello, I am Shahmeer.

## Professional Statement
I am Shahmeer Abbasi. I am a third year Computer Science student at the University of New Brunswick with a specialization in Cybersecurity. I have experience working both consultancy based and technical roles as an intern at companies like PwC and a bank. I am Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) through The International Information System Security Certification Consortium. 

Recently, I completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to pursue my passion for technology and Cybersecurity. My ultimate goal is to become a Security Analyst. This role suits me because I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, eagerness to learn, problem-solving skills, and communication skills to address problems and emerging threats. 

As of 2025, I am preparing to take the CompTIA Security+ certification and looking for a Co-op position starting in the summer.
